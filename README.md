# Pizza-Sales-Data

This is a Tableau dashboard depicting the pizza sales data for the year of 2015. I have included sql queries that explain how I answered each of my questions/problems, which lead to the creation of the sales dashboard. I worked with MySQL as well to be able to execite the queries and then connect my data to server to Tableau. Below is a quick run-down of each of the files and their purpose:

Pizza_Sales.twb - The Tableau dashboard that contains all of the visuals from the data I have queried and formated (best viewed in presentation mode)

Pizza_Sales_image.png - A screenshot of the final dashboard and how it should appear

pizza_sales.csv - The data set that I used for this project

pizzadataqueries.sql - MySQL queries with explainations for each section I was trying to calculate for. Note that I did not use every calculation in the final dashboard, but chose the ones I felt were the most important to present on the dashboard.

If it requires you to connect to MySQL or another local server, here are the username and password:
